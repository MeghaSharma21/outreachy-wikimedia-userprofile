This is a mockup for the MicroTask 3 where we've built for the profile of a person which can be shared anywhere, conceptually similar to the developer profiles of Github or StackOverflow.

Key highlights of the mockup are:

(The main mockup is in PDF named **profile.pdf.**)

1. We'll have **ratings for the person** - we've thought of 3 different kinds of ratings - 

* Overall Rating : Which will be calculated for every user assigning different weights to the no. of edits, no. of views, admin, no. of pages created, no. of pages edited, no. of  approved articles etc. These weights and exact formula can be discussed. Users will be ranked on the basis of this rating.

* View Rating :  Based on the number of views and the time a user spends on the articles (we can get this through google analytics) a user has edited or created (Edited and Created are given different weights)

* Edit Rating : Based on the amount of contribution user has done (Both pages created and edited), in terms of bytes.

2. We'll have **badges for users**, like 

* Top 1% - telling that the user is amongst Top 1% contributors

* Admin - telling that the user is admin

* 100+ Edits - telling that the user has 100+ edited pages

* 1000+ views - telling that the user's edited/created pages have 1000+ views

The different kinds of badges we'll have can be discussed.

3. We'll have different tabs containing: 

* Introduction of the user

* Wikimedia Summary containing information like UserID, first edit, last edit, no. of edits etc

* Achievements of the user

* Publications of the user will be listed in the profile. This will help the user to display his/her published articles.

* Contribution timeline: (All types of graphs are present in PDF named **graphs.pdf**).

    * Graphs showing pages edited and created by him

    * Graphs showing comparison between pages edited and created by him, average user and max values.

All the graphs will be filterable on two parameters, time (1hr, 6hr, 7days, 15 days etc) and namespace (Article, Talk, User etc).

* Pinned Articles: These will be the articles pinned by the user on his profile, which he wants others to see. On similar lines to pinned repositories in github profile.

4. It will also show the no. of followers of the user and the no. of people whom the user is following. This will help in building a network of people who are using wikimedia.

5. Also, the feature of ‘**Compare Profile**’ will allow the concept of gamification to set in. This comparison will introduce competitiveness among the user and keep them motivated. Users’ profile will be compared on the following parameters:

* Ratings 

* Contributions in terms of edits, creations and views

* Badges

* Achievements

* Publications

* Interests

Its design mockup is in the PDF named **compareProfile.pdf**
